I was tinkering around a bit with san serifs, and created this ayuche font. 
Ayuche is short for Alvin yuche, and this font face only comes in Regular, and Stroke versions

Do enjoy your download here. 

You can view the Demos.
By the way sans are my favorite variations, unless i do find something wonderful in the future

It is what you read when you don’t have to that determines what you will be when you can’t help it.
