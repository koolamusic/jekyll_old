This is a free san serif typography that replaces the Dollar Sign (shift +3) with a Naira stroke instead, all in a bid to grow the Naira right? at least some designers wont have issues with having to insert the Naira into any of their designs. 
===


All this started when i began exploring alternatives to making my own typography, having font faces look exactly the way i wanted them to be, maybe a little slab on the letter '**J**' or a more controversial slant on the letter small caps **'y'**; since most folks around arent comfortable with paying for Font face subscriptions or buying new typefaces, i had to think around.

By the way Web Designers in Nigeria know that clients are quite hard-headed about stuffs like this [WHY DO I NEED A CUSTOM TYPEFACE] while everybody loves good stuff, it yet easn't easy to get them to pay for it until you've either built TRUST, LONGTERM RELATIONSHIP, or a TRIAL of conviction; SO YOU'D RATHER NOT BUY THE SUBSCRIPTIONS, BECAUSE THEY'LL MIGHT AS WELL JUST STAY THERE, and since the kind of type you'd want are in the elevated subscription models, one has to start looking at alternatives; Google Fonts do try and are awesome in there way; But not every one wants their website to look the same as the one with Montserrat or Lato, thats how i came across font forge, if you use UBUNTU OR ANY LINUX DISTRO WITH DESKTOP SUPPORT, you can download font forge for free

One thing i'll like to scratch is that, its easy to design your font lines in COREL DRAW or ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR and export as a .eps file which you can open in inkscape on ubuntu and paste into font forge. 

But this is not a How to Design my own font tutorial, This is a Download the Free Naira Font 

Get it also on Dafonts.com

so feel free to download The Naira Font.
