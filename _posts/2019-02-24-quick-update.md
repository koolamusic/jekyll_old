Corpers are lamenting the treatment meted on them. A corps member said they were not informed that they will have to stay till midnight nor were they informed that they would return to the office late at night. Materials are still being collected by the INEC officials. A corps member by the name Motunrayo says the INEC is short staffed and incompetent.
