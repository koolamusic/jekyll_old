I found this in my archive, and I consider them very valuable advise.

### These are the rules of Life

- **Know what you have**
- **Do a mental audit on your assets [knowledge, money, information]**
- **Value what you have**
- **Use what you have**
- **The fastest way to solve your problem is to find those who have that problem and start solving it**
- **Every problem you have is a clue to a problem you are about to solve**
- **Keep distributing what you have**

*More importantly, play with the cards you've been dealt with, and if you dont have any **BLUFF***
