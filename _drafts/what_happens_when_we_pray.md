Sometimes when we pray, the answer we expect God to give us is not the one He offers
In most cases he chooses a part that would give us more than we asked for.
we only need patience to see through and listen for his direction, He has
already answer, we only need listen and loose our opinions, then we will see
the way he has made.

When Abraham wanted to sacrifice Isaac, He was certain that isaac was the lamb when God had a plan,
Abraham not only learnt about God's infinite provision, He also experienced God in a totally new dimension,
Nothing stopped Abraham from carrying extra cattle and leaving it behind with his servants incase God changed his mind
or spoke to his servants.

When you pray, have faith that he would answer.
He always answers, you just need to keep your logger in listen_mode
Because you've got your testimony already
