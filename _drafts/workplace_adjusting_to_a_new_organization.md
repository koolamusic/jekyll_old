In a new work environment always ask questions, It if more profitable for you to look stupid asking questions, than to look stupid taking the wrong decisions or 
steps to engagement, after every formal on-boarding process you will always be assigned to a HOD, always ask enough questions from the company resources you can 
use, to the nature of engagement for sales, to how projects are organized and communicated, down to even trivial issues like how lunch is, kitchen policies and 
food. 

It is very important you keep an open mind and inquisitive one too, but more importantly before you ask questions make sure you are good at your job, make sure 
you do it very well. This gives you the confidence to be able to walk up to the person in charge and request for answers to anything you dont understand, common 
issues like which table to use, which printer or scanner to use and how to use it, Which cups are available for your use in the dispensary, are important. 

More importantly when being introduced to your teammates, you will likely find someone who is interested in your success, to spot such persons, they are the ones 
that naturally ask you where you are coming from, where you reside, what you studied, where you did your youth service, be careful to spot these few or particular 
person, because they ask you this question discretely and always have an input to make in order to connect. 

So be proud to ask, so you don't fail. 
You dont wanna use the wrong cup
You dont wanna approach the delicate client wrongly
You dont wanna provoke Mike the one who wants no paper on his table, 

As a rule of thumb, feel ok to ask 
Is there any rule I should know about ?
Is there any thing I should know about my job ?


These questions are for your boss ?
