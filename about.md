## New Blog Who this ?

Here I am on this internet space ... A pre-advanced piano player, musician, web developer, network administrator, budding music director, Andrew Miracle is one of the most diverse and multi-faceted personalities in this world (Al' Davids '2010'). Happy and fun at heart, I am born in Nigeria, into a wonderful family of cheerful smarties, !hit me up when you've got the chance, i'll just love to talk.
